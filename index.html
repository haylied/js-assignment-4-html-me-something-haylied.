          Dance is the unspoken language of the body. It tells stories, conveys
          meaning, and carries history through the generations by moving the
          body in a rhythmic way. Whether used for social, communal,
          competitive, or sacred practices, dance has been used as a vehicle for
          expression for tens of thousands of years.

            Dance has always been an indispensable element of life in African
            society, binding together communities and helping individuals
            understand their roles within their communities. The unique
            characteristics of ancient African dance encompass spirituality in
            repetition, drumming, and polyrhythmic movement. Spiritual and
            coming-of-age rituals are present in many African cultures as dance
            helps members of their community understand and connect to their
            higher power. Some of the more popular African dances in Westernized
            societies include South Africa's Zulu tribes' Agbadza Dance, Gombey
            Dance, Mbira Dance, and Gwara Gwara African Dance. African dance has
            a rich and complex history that directly reflects the beauty of the
            immense diversity of the continent itself.

            Dance throughout Asia has a rich history, dating as far back as the
            Neolithic period. The Chinese culture has some of the earliest forms
            of documented dance history in spiritual and ceremonial practices.
            These dances expressed gratitude to the gods and ancestors, prayed
            for good harvests, and celebrated life events. Over time, Chinese
            dance evolved into a sophisticated art form with unique styles and
            techniques. Traditional dances today have shifted from the community
            to the theatre. The resulting dance dramas and masked dance mimes of
            Thailand, Cambodia, and Java are famous for their grandiose scale
            and elegance in overall execution.

            The earliest roots of Latin American dance came from indigenous
            societies like the Aztecs, Guarani, Aymara, Incas, and Tehuelches.
            In Aztec communities, dance played a part in sacrificial ceremonies
            to ornate the delivery of gifts to the gods. Fast forward a few
            centuries to modern-day, and Latin American dance has influenced
            popular music and culture around the globe for decades. Latin dance
            has helped shape how people think about movement and has played an
            important role in Latin American societies for centuries. Dance has
            been a part of celebratory religious festivals and ceremonial events
            such as weddings and funerals, as well as to document, express, and
            translate stories of their people. Whether it's the fiery rhythms of
            the salsa and tango or the smooth styles of bolero and the exciting
            spectacle of the cha-cha, Latin dance continues to captivate
            audiences all over the world as well.

            Europe is most famously known as the birthplace of ballet. Ballet
            was formed during the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th and
            16th centuries, before spreading to the French, where many people
            believe ballet orgininated. In the 17th century, King Henry XIV of
            France further shaped and codified ballet by documenting dance on
            paper and introducing social dances from paegan traditions in tandem
            with music, speech, song, decorum and costume. Today ballet has
            spread to almost every continent around the globe and has affected
            and influenced change in other dance forms due to colonization.

          <p>
            North American dance history is diverse and includes a range of
            traditons from indigenous tribal dances to Western and African
            influenced social, performance and concert dance forms. Indigenous
            communities from around North America each had their own traditional
            dances to celebrate rites of passage, spirtual events, festivities,
            and the supernatural. These are the originating dances of this
            contentent.

          <p>
            Due to the events of colonization, the Westernized dance forms of
            ballet and other pagan genres transferred over to the new land. To
            be popular with the masses, White Americans had to change some
            traditions and adapt (technically steal) to keep current and acquire
            a new audience. In the post-Civil War and pre-Civil Right's Movement
            era, there was a boom in African/Black American art, music, dance,
            and much more. The blues and jazz music movement of the late 19th to
            early 20th century lead to the creation of Jazz, Tap, and Modern
            dance. As the times changed, so did the art of music and dance.
            Disco and Hip-hop music lead to the direct creation of their dance
            styles. Drag Queens evolved modern house dancing into a highly
            stylized dance form called Vouging. Had it not been for
            African/Black American art, all popular culture/mainstream art forms
            would not be what it is today.
